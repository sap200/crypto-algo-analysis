# crypto-algo-analysis


### **Objective**

- *Consider OPENSSL APIS and their use for several encryption and decryption operations with a fixed random symmetric key of 128 bits. Use cbc operation mode.*

- *Consider the following three algorithms: AES, aria and camellia. They will be compared.*

- *Organize your comparison for both encryption and decryption by using three fixed files. A 1kb text file, a 10kb text file and a big (>1MB binary file).* 

- *Take the times and report them in some drawings.*
